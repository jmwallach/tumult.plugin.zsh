# Open a new iTerm session with the command given
# as argument.
#
# - If there are no arguments, the new iTerm window will
#   be opened in the current directory, i.e. as if the command
#   would be "cd `pwd`".
# - If the first argument is a directory, the new iTerm will
#   "cd" into that directory before executing the remaining
#   arguments as command.
# - If there are arguments and the first one is not a directory,
#   the new window will be opened in the current directory and
#   then the arguments will be executed as command.
# - The optional, leading "-x" flag will cause the new terminal
#   to be closed immediately after the executed command finishes.
